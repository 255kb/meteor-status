#Meteor Status

##What is it?
Meteor Status is a package which automatically alerts users when the connection to the server has been lost.
It also shows a countdown (in seconds) until the next retry and allows users to manually retry in the meantime.

##Installation

Just add the package in Meteor with this command:

`meteor add 255kb:meteor-status`
